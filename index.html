                    CASTELLA's aim is to lay the mathematical foundation to help you in your spiritual journey
                    towards the
                    deathless element via the total absolute understanding of the true nature of reality, which is said
                    to transcend all forms,
                    senses,
                    perceptions and
                    mental constructs. In
                    the Buddhist tradition, the deathless element is what is referred to as
                    nibbāna or nirvāṇa.

                    { There are many nice sutras to read before vipassanā meditation practices. Below is one for
                    example }

                        Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi in the Deer Park
                        at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus:
                        “Bhikkhus!”<br />
                        <br />

                        “Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:<br />
                        <br />

                        “Bhikkhus, form is nonself. For if, bhikkhus, form were self, this form would not lead to
                        affliction, and it would be possible to have it of form: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form
                        not be thus.’ But because form is nonself, form leads to affliction, and it is not possible
                        to have it of form: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus.’<br />
                        <br />

                        “Feeling is nonself…. … Perception is nonself…. Volitional formations are nonself….
                        Consciousness is nonself. For if, bhikkhus, consciousness were self, this consciousness
                        would not lead to affliction, and it would be possible to have it of consciousness: ‘Let my
                        consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be thus.’ But because consciousness is
                        nonself, consciousness leads to affliction, and it is not possible to have it of
                        consciousness: ‘Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be thus.’<br />
                        <br />

                        “What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable
                        sir.”—“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—“Suffering, venerable sir.”—“Is what
                        is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine,
                        this I am, this is my self’?”—“No, venerable sir.”<br />
                        <br />

                        “Is feeling permanent or impermanent?… Is perception permanent or impermanent?… Are
                        volitional formations permanent or impermanent?… Is consciousness permanent or
                        impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent suffering or
                        happiness?”— “Suffering, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to
                        change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”—“No, venerable
                        sir.”<br />
                        <br />

                        “Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present,
                        internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form should be
                        seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
                        my self.’<br />
                        <br />

                        “Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional
                        formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or
                        present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all
                        consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine,
                        this I am not, this is not my self.’<br />
                        <br />

                        “Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form,
                        revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional
                        formations, revulsion towards consciousness. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes
                        dispassionate. Through dispassion his mind is liberated. When it is liberated there comes
                        the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been
                        lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”<br />
                        <br />

                        That is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s
                        statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the bhikkhus of the group
                        of five were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.
