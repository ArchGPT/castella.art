                        Cetanā</a>, as well as the construction of Anāgata Cetanā Monasteries around the world.
                </div><br /><br />
                <div>The first Anāgata Cetanā Monastery will be constructed by 2030 that will include a Montessori
                    school, 4 meditation chambers, 2 libraries, a garden and a farm, as well as providing short-term
                    housing to
                    42
                    Anāgata Cetanā Recluses and their
                    spouses who
                    they are legally married to, and their children. The research focus of the first Anāgata Cetanā
                    Monastery is on
                    the conscious control of
                    physicology via the use of various tantra for the prolongation of life and the slow-down of
                    biological aging.</div>
                <br /><br />
                Anāgata Cetanā's aim is to propagate loving-kindness and pure compassion with the great secret wisdom of
                utilizing advanced meditation techniques in combination with diets and tantra so to enable Recluses who
                practice
                loving-kindness and pure compassion to live and stay healthy almost indefinitely. It is in this way
                that a decentralized Anāgata Cetanā society of
                loving-kindness
                and pure compassion would emerge around the world.
                <br /><br />

                The non-violent way to solve all of humanity's cultural-political problems is simply for such a
                decentralized society of
                loving-kindness
                and pure compassion to outlive all these existing systems
                operating for the sole benefits of corrupted
                capitalists
                and politicians of the 21st century (i.e. those who are spreading the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_poisons" target="_blank">three poisons</a> in this world,
                and are so blinded by greed and
                selfishness that they
                are incapable of loving-kindness
                and pure compassion.) New systems that value authenticity and loving-kindness shall arise. It is in this
                way that the propagation of loving-kindness
                and pure compassion will always surpass the three poisons.<br /><br />
                It is in this way that part of humanity (those who practice
                loving-kindness
                and pure compassion with the secret wisdom of the Anāgata Cetanā tantra) will gradually evolve (both
                biologically as well as technologically)
                into
                a
                new species that will share a similiar ability as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_nutricula">Turritopsis nutricula</a> for longevity
                in loving-kindness and pure compassion.
